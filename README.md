# A single-cell transcriptional atlas of lung parenchyma in smoking-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
## Overview
Here we constructed the largest single-cell transcriptome atlas of lung parenchyma from 101 individuals spanning from healthy controls to different COPD stages, coupled with comprehensive clinical information. We also provided an interactive website for more researchers to explore our atlas [https://www.copdatlas.com/]. Other information can be found in our paper entitled "A single-cell transcriptional atlas of lung parenchyma in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease". 

## Codes
For scRNA-seq data processing, you can find the codes in this repository. Details of pulmonary function prediction model by scPIT are available at: [https://github.com/Yu-Lab-Genomics/scPIT].

## Data
The raw sequence data of scRNA-seq have been deposited to Genome Sequence Archive (GSA) in the National Genomics Data Center, China National Center for Bioinformation/Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences under accession code [HRA010782](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/search/specific?db=hra&q=HRA010782).
