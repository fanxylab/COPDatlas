# COPDatlas
Here we constructed the largest single-cell transcriptome atlas of lung parenchyma from 101 individuals spanning from healthy controls to different COPD stages, coupled with comprehensive clinical information. We also provided an interactive website for more researchers to explore our atlas [https://www.copdatlas.com/].

This repository contains codes associated with paper entitled "A single-cell transcriptional atlas of lung parenchyma in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease". 

For scRNA-seq data and Visium HD data processing, you can find the codes in this repository. Details of lung function prediction model by scPIT are available at: [https://github.com/Yu-Lab-Genomics/scPIT].

The raw sequence data of scRNA-seq have been deposited to Genome Sequence Archive (GSA) in the National Genomics Data Center, China National Center for Bioinformation/Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences under accession code HRA010782. The raw sequence data of Visium HD have been also deposited to GSA under accession code HRA010949.
